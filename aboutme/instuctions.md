Hey Create your about me page 

I installed bootstrap allready in there
there called CND where you get the link and source bootstrap or 
you can download bootstrap into you applcation like i did and make sure you refernce each link to each directory 

ie 

<link src="/static/img/imgaName.jpg">
<link src="/static/css/app.css">
etc you get the format, always goodle 

to set up python routes: 

1. first create src directory 

2. on command line from root: mkdir src 
3. cd src 
4. mkdir projects
5. git clone https://github.com/rebecca/Spoon-Knife
